        //Mad Lib
        /*Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story template with blanks for words.
        You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them into the story,
        creating an often silly or funny story as a result.
        Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and an
        adjective and injects those into a story that you create.
        Example Output
            Enter a noun: dog
            Enter a verb: walk
            Enter an adjective: blue
            Enter an adverb: quickly
            Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!
        Constraints
            Use a single output statement for this program.
            If your language supports string interpolation or string substitution, use it to
            build up the output.*/

        System.out.print("Enter a verb: ");
        String verb = input.nextLine();

        System.out.print("Enter an adjective: ");
        String adj = input.nextLine();

        System.out.print("Enter and adverb: ");
        String adverb = input.nextLine();

        System.out.println("Do you " + verb + " your " + adj + " " + noun + " " + adverb + "? That's hilarious!");
